Roman art and architecture 

# Early chronology of Rome

Earliest roman story starts not with Romans but  Villanuovans and Etruscans, people north of Rome, around 1000 BCE. Note this is around the end of the bronze age (1700) and the beginning of Iron (1000).
The chronology of this time is divided in Archaic I and II, roughly corresponding to 1000-750 (also named early Iron age) and 700 ~600 .

Archaic I:  Unified culture enter italy from the north. Rise of the villanovans in Tuscany. Latins at Latium.
 Archaic II: Villanovans flourish, art develops, geometric influences from greece. Rise of the Etruscans

# Etruscans (1000-600), 

The early history of rome, also known as the orientalizing period is punctuated by the construction of the cloaca maxima, one of the earliest drainage and sewer systems in the world, built by etruscans in 600. 

Also representative of the architecture of the period are the Tumuli resting places of Cerveteri built around 650, an eclectic necropolis of raised circular tumbs. (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1158)

During the orientalization period Etruscans syncretized many of the myths with their own practices. 

## Archaic after Orientalization (600-500)

Representative of the period after orientalization are the tombs of Tarquinia build around 530 BCE which show previous influences and depict clearly etruscan rites making use of and advanced understanding of phisiology.

# Latter Etruscans 

Greek art very popular around the time, a prime example being the 570 BCE Tuscany vase called the Francois Vase. It bears the inscriptions "Ergotimos mepoiesen" and "Kleitias megraphsen", meaning "Ergotimos made me" and "Kleitias painted me". It depicts 270 mythological figures. 

Another fundamental example of the art of the time is the Chimera of Arezzo c. 400 BC, a bronze of the mythical figure with the head of a lion, tail of a serpent and protruding head of a goat which was killed by Bellerophon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_of_Arezzo#/media/File:Chimera_d%27arezzo,_fi,_04.JPG). Bellerophon, incidentally, was the tamer of pegasus, which was born out of the blood flowing from medusa.

Statue of Voltumna at el campo della fiera, in modern day Orvieto was a key point of congregation for all Etruscans.  Fanum Voltumnae means altar or sanctuary of Voltumna. Voltumna or Voltha was the central goddess of Etruscans.

Note how by the time it is incorporated by romans it is transformed into male god of seasons Vertumnus (familiar because of Arcimboldo’s fruit-made painting and because of his transformation into an old woman to seduce Pomona) and not into Vesta. The key goddess Vesta in the roman tradition (vestal virgins) has her closest counterpart in the greek Hestia, goddess of hearth, home, tradition.

In the fourth and third centuries, after roman defeat the etruscan art will turn darker and heavier in its death imagery. An example of this is the tomb of the infernal quadriga (infernal chariot) with its three-headed serpent adorning the entrance to the cthonic realm.

# The Rise of the Roman Republic

Although rome was founded way before, on the 21st of april of 723, the romanization of italy and the transition from etruscan to roman center begins in the 4th and 3rd centuries. Roughly the key dates to remember are Villanuovans 1000, Etruscans 800, Romans 500.

## Early Republic (509-200)

The etruscans are thrown out of rome in 509. At this point the Forum had already been drained by the Etruscan king Tarquinius Superbus.

The temple of Saturn, 498, and the temple of Vesta are prime examples of the early republic architecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Saturn#/media/File:Temple_of_Saturn,_Rome.jpg and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Vesta#/media/File:Temple_of_Vesta_(Rome).jpg) 

Vesta is also important and related to rome because it his her union with Mars that produces Romulus and Remus.

The forum romanum is first established during this time and it includes the sacra via at which edge one can find the Regia which was home of the leaders and later the seat for the Pontifex Maximus (pope).

On the same way, the sacra via, and in the forum in general, many other times and leaders would add and change monuments. An example is the Arch of Titus which is a typical anachronism in movies of the early empire as it was constructed later by Domitian in 82 AD.


# Types of Temple/Column

The adoption of the three greek “orders” or styles of architecture occurred around 100 BCE and has been continued in their essence to our days.

The three modes are Doric, Ionic, Corinthian. They can be memorized as increasing complexity over a number of key variables, most importantly the style of the *capitals* (the top of each column), the number of *flutes* (fluting refers to the ridges in the column, 0/20,24 respectively), the *base* (from no base to round torus) and the entablature they support (the horizontal band on top of the columns). Other elements part of the order are less distinctive/readily-identifying such as the proportions of column height to width.

Other parts of the building, such as the tympanum/pediment (the triangle on top of the entablature) can vary independent of the order.

## The Angle-Triglyph Problem

The entablature (horizontal bar on top of the columns) is divided in alternating sections: triglyphs and metopes.

The angle-triglyph problem refers to the conciliation (or lack of) between two rules of ancient architecture:

Every other triglyph must rest over the center of the column below it
Each architrave (horizontal top) has to en with a triglyph

This can be represented as:

T M T M T M T M T M T
C            C            C
C            C            C

You can tell a modern building taking the classic style has failed if the corners of the entablatures don’t end in triglyphs but instead on an awkward little space.



##  Interim - Rough Timeline Review

1000 - 600 Archaic
600 - 500 Etruscan rule:  cloaca maxima
500 - 300 Classical 
300 - 31   Hellenistic

## Middle Republic

Hellenistic constant warfare and expansion, north with etruscans, east and south with Carthage and Spain. The rise of iconography and the development of concrete start huge new architectural possibilities.

Typical of the period is the Capitoline Brutus  (4C and 3C) https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h-qUlzA70nY/maxresdefault.jpg , Lucius Junius Brutus, the man who killed the last king and effectively started the roman republic. This identity to the sculpture was assigned in the 16C. First attempt at veristic portraiture.

## Interim - Carthage: A mirage of antiquity

In 149 BC Carthage suffer roman destruction but had a key role before and survives after. 
Original settlers were Berbers, semi-nomad libyans with a 8000 year lineage (some traditions of theirs in the making of food and basic living still survive in modern day Carthage). Around 700 BCE phoenicians from Lebanon take over, followed by Romans.

Not just the history but myth of Carthage are mixed with Rome’s: Phoenician Dido suicides over Aeneas, who goes on to found rome according to latter republican story.

Carthage reaches its zenith on the 6C. At this point the main deities are Baal- Hammon (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Terracotta_statue_of_Baal-Hammon_on_a_throne_AvL.JPG) and Tanit fertility goddess. Her symbol persists to this day (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Tophet_Carthage.2.jpg)

### Roman-Punic Wars 246 BC - 146 BC

Not to be confused with the greco-punic wars much earlier over sicily (600-250), the Roman punic wars feature hannibal crossing the alps, and the eventual destruction of carthage. 

The most representative piece of architecture of the time is not exactly in Carthage but nearby in the surviving Dougga Theater, the best preserved african roman theater of its time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga)

By the 7C Carthage is taken over by muslims.

## Civil Wars 1BCE

59 BCE Caesar Rises
44 Caesar dies, Marc Anthony and Cleopatra, Triumvirate 
31 Octavian rallies people against Marc Anthony and consolidates
27 Rise of Augustus as sole Emperor

Meanwhile in architecture first experimentation with concrete is taking place. Representative pieces are the Fortuna Primigenia sanctuary in Panestre (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestrina#/media/File:Santuario_emiciclo_colonne_4.JPG) 

Portraiture is veristic, as shown even by the first Julius Caesar coin. However, the greek influence is also very much present, as shown by the idolino de Pesaro,  an augustan time roman copy of a greek sculpture by Polykleitos.

# Early Empire: Augustus

Octavius beats Marc Anthony with the help of Agrippa, mainly in the famous naval battle of Actium. This consolidation starts the peaceful and productive period of the empire known as Pax Augusta or Pax Romana (27BC to 180)

The Roman statue of Augustus based on the Doryphoros of Polykleitos is by far the most recognizable of the time. The small figure at the feet of Augustus is not a homunculus as claimed by some occultists but Cupid, son of Venus, a nice allusion and connection to Caesar, the adoptive Father of Augustus who claimed to descend from the Goddess herself.

Augustus was the initiator/big force behind the notion of the Romans as Trojans. Aeneas comes back from Troy with his dad in his shoulder and his Son lulus.

## Interim: Historical Veracity of Troy

The story narrated in the Iliad was meant to take place around 1200 BC. The poem was written around 8C and was very popular in Augustus time. Agamemnon leads Achilles and other mycenaeans against the trojans. 

Although widely credited for the discovery of archeological troy in Turkey in 1868, Heinrich Schleiman was definitely NOT the first one to make the discovery but rather the person with enough money to claim it and publicize it. Calvert had made the discovery in Hissarlix years before.

## Augustan Rome

18 BCE Legistation fomenting family values is passed. Idea of a golden age permeates art.   Augustus complained of having two wayward daughters: Rome and Julia. Livia is indeed a key figure in the process of promoting the legislation and exiling Julia. 

Typical of these ideals, of the high values and quality of the time is The Ara Pacis, a temple to Pax built between 13 and 9 BC. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis#/media/File:Ara_Pacis_Rom.jpg

## Interim: Quick timeline of Imperial Rome

Augustus: 31BCE-14CE
Tiberius: -37 
Claudius: -54
Nero: -68

## Tiberius and Caligula

Tiberius art in Capri and Sperlonga is highly theatrical and mythological including homer scenes, notably the surviving sculptures of odysseus ship attacked by Scylla: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperlonga_sculptures#/media/File:Gruppo_di_scilla,_sperlonga.jpg
