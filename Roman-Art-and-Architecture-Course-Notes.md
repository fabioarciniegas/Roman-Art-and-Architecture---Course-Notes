Roman art and architecture 

# Early chronology of Rome

Earliest roman story starts not with Romans but  Villanuovans and Etruscans, people north of Rome, around 1000 BCE. Note this is around the end of the bronze age (1700) and the beginning of Iron (1000).
The chronology of this time is divided in Archaic I and II, roughly corresponding to 1000-750 (also named early Iron age) and 700 ~600 .

Archaic I:  Unified culture enter italy from the north. Rise of the villanovans in Tuscany. Latins at Latium.
 Archaic II: Villanovans flourish, art develops, geometric influences from greece. Rise of the Etruscans

# Etruscans (1000-600), 

The early history of rome, also known as the orientalizing period is punctuated by the construction of the cloaca maxima, one of the earliest drainage and sewer systems in the world, built by etruscans in 600. 

Also representative of the architecture of the period are the Tumuli resting places of Cerveteri built around 650, an eclectic necropolis of raised circular tumbs. (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1158)

During the orientalization period Etruscans syncretized many of the myths with their own practices. 

## Archaic after Orientalization (600-500)

Representative of the period after orientalization are the tombs of Tarquinia build around 530 BCE which show previous influences and depict clearly etruscan rites making use of and advanced understanding of phisiology.

# Latter Etruscans 

Greek art very popular around the time, a prime example being the 570 BCE Tuscany vase called the Francois Vase. It bears the inscriptions "Ergotimos mepoiesen" and "Kleitias megraphsen", meaning "Ergotimos made me" and "Kleitias painted me". It depicts 270 mythological figures. 

Another fundamental example of the art of the time is the Chimera of Arezzo c. 400 BC, a bronze of the mythical figure with the head of a lion, tail of a serpent and protruding head of a goat which was killed by Bellerophon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_of_Arezzo#/media/File:Chimera_d%27arezzo,_fi,_04.JPG). Bellerophon, incidentally, was the tamer of pegasus, which was born out of the blood flowing from medusa.

Statue of Voltumna at el campo della fiera, in modern day Orvieto was a key point of congregation for all Etruscans.  Fanum Voltumnae means altar or sanctuary of Voltumna. Voltumna or Voltha was the central goddess of Etruscans.

Note how by the time it is incorporated by romans it is transformed into male god of seasons Vertumnus (familiar because of Arcimboldoâ€™s fruit-made painting and because of his transformation into an old woman to seduce Pomona) and not into Vesta. The key goddess Vesta in the roman tradition (vestal virgins) has her closest counterpart in the greek Hestia, goddess of hearth, home, tradition.

In the fourth and third centuries, after roman defeat the etruscan art will turn darker and heavier in its death imagery. An example of this is the tomb of the infernal quadriga (infernal chariot) with its three-headed serpent adorning the entrance to the cthonic realm.

# The Rise of the Roman Republic

Although rome was founded way before, on the 21st of april of 723, the romanization of italy and the transition from etruscan to roman center begins in the 4th and 3rd centuries. Roughly the key dates to remember are Villanuovans 1000, Etruscans 800, Romans 500.

## Early Republic (509-200)

The etruscans are thrown out of rome in 509. At this point the Forum had already been drained by the Etruscan king Tarquinius Superbus.

The temple of Saturn, 498, and the temple of Vesta are prime examples of the early republic architecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Saturn#/media/File:Temple_of_Saturn,_Rome.jpg and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Vesta#/media/File:Temple_of_Vesta_(Rome).jpg) 

Vesta is also important and related to rome because it his her union with Mars that produces Romulus and Remus.

The forum romanum is first established during this time and it includes the sacra via at which edge one can find the Regia which was home of the leaders and later the seat for the Pontifex Maximus (pope).

On the same way, the sacra via, and in the forum in general, many other times and leaders would add and change monuments. An example is the Arch of Titus which is a typical anachronism in movies of the early empire as it was constructed later by Domitian in 82 AD.
