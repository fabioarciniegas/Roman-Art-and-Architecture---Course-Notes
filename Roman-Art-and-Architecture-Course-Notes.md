Roman art and architecture 

# Early chronology of Rome

Earliest roman story starts not with Romans but  Villanuovans and Etruscans, people north of Rome, around 1000 BCE. Note this is around the end of the bronze age (1700) and the beginning of Iron (1000).
The chronology of this time is divided in Archaic I and II, roughly corresponding to 1000-750 (also named early Iron age) and 700 ~600 .

Archaic I:  Unified culture enter italy from the north. Rise of the villanovans in Tuscany. Latins at Latium.
 Archaic II: Villanovans flourish, art develops, geometric influences from greece. Rise of the Etruscans

# Etruscans (1000-600), 

The early history of rome, also known as the orientalizing period is punctuated by the construction of the cloaca maxima, one of the earliest drainage and sewer systems in the world, built by etruscans in 600. 

Also representative of the architecture of the period are the Tumuli resting places of Cerveteri built around 650, an eclectic necropolis of raised circular tumbs. (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1158)

During the orientalization period Etruscans syncretized many of the myths with their own practices. 

## Archaic after Orientalization (600-500)

Representative of the period after orientalization are the tombs of Tarquinia build around 530 BCE which show previous influences and depict clearly etruscan rites making use of and advanced understanding of phisiology.

# Latter Etruscans 

Greek art very popular around the time, a prime example being the 570 BCE Tuscany vase called the Francois Vase. It bears the inscriptions "Ergotimos mepoiesen" and "Kleitias megraphsen", meaning "Ergotimos made me" and "Kleitias painted me". It depicts 270 mythological figures. 

Another fundamental example of the art of the time is the Chimera of Arezzo c. 400 BC, a bronze of the mythical figure with the head of a lion, tail of a serpent and protruding head of a goat which was killed by Bellerophon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_of_Arezzo#/media/File:Chimera_d%27arezzo,_fi,_04.JPG). Bellerophon, incidentally, was the tamer of pegasus, which was born out of the blood flowing from medusa.

Statue of Voltumna at el campo della fiera, in modern day Orvieto was a key point of congregation for all Etruscans.  Fanum Voltumnae means altar or sanctuary of Voltumna. Voltumna or Voltha was the central goddess of Etruscans.

Note how by the time it is incorporated by romans it is transformed into male god of seasons Vertumnus (familiar because of Arcimboldo’s fruit-made painting and because of his transformation into an old woman to seduce Pomona) and not into Vesta. The key goddess Vesta in the roman tradition (vestal virgins) has her closest counterpart in the greek Hestia, goddess of hearth, home, tradition.

In the fourth and third centuries, after roman defeat the etruscan art will turn darker and heavier in its death imagery. An example of this is the tomb of the infernal quadriga (infernal chariot) with its three-headed serpent adorning the entrance to the cthonic realm.

# The Rise of the Roman Republic

Although rome was founded way before, on the 21st of april of 723, the romanization of italy and the transition from etruscan to roman center begins in the 4th and 3rd centuries. Roughly the key dates to remember are Villanuovans 1000, Etruscans 800, Romans 500.

## Early Republic (509-200)

The etruscans are thrown out of rome in 509. At this point the Forum had already been drained by the Etruscan king Tarquinius Superbus.

The temple of Saturn, 498, and the temple of Vesta are prime examples of the early republic architecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Saturn#/media/File:Temple_of_Saturn,_Rome.jpg and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Vesta#/media/File:Temple_of_Vesta_(Rome).jpg) 

Vesta is also important and related to rome because it his her union with Mars that produces Romulus and Remus.

The forum romanum is first established during this time and it includes the sacra via at which edge one can find the Regia which was home of the leaders and later the seat for the Pontifex Maximus (pope).

On the same way, the sacra via, and in the forum in general, many other times and leaders would add and change monuments. An example is the Arch of Titus which is a typical anachronism in movies of the early empire as it was constructed later by Domitian in 82 AD.


# Types of Temple/Column

The adoption of the three greek “orders” or styles of architecture occurred around 100 BCE and has been continued in their essence to our days.

The three modes are Doric, Ionic, Corinthian. They can be memorized as increasing complexity over a number of key variables, most importantly the style of the *capitals* (the top of each column), the number of *flutes* (fluting refers to the ridges in the column, 0/20,24 respectively), the *base* (from no base to round torus) and the entablature they support (the horizontal band on top of the columns). Other elements part of the order are less distinctive/readily-identifying such as the proportions of column height to width.

Other parts of the building, such as the tympanum/pediment (the triangle on top of the entablature) can vary independent of the order.

## The Angle-Triglyph Problem

The entablature (horizontal bar on top of the columns) is divided in alternating sections: triglyphs and metopes.

http://www.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/thumbnails/entablature.jpeg


The angle-triglyph problem refers to the conciliation (or lack of) between two rules of ancient architecture:

Every other triglyph must rest over the center of the column below it
Each architrave (horizontal top) has to en with a triglyph

This can be represented as:

T M T M T M T M T M T
C            C            C
C            C            C

You can tell a modern building taking the classic style has failed if the corners of the entablatures don’t end in triglyphs but instead on an awkward little space.



##  Interim - Rough Timeline Review

1000 - 600 Archaic
600 - 500 Etruscan rule:  cloaca maxima
500 - 300 Classical 
300 - 31   Hellenistic

## Middle Republic

Hellenistic constant warfare and expansion, north with etruscans, east and south with Carthage and Spain. The rise of iconography and the development of concrete start huge new architectural possibilities.

Typical of the period is the Capitoline Brutus  (4C and 3C) https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h-qUlzA70nY/maxresdefault.jpg , Lucius Junius Brutus, the man who killed the last king and effectively started the roman republic. This identity to the sculpture was assigned in the 16C. First attempt at veristic portraiture.

## Interim - Carthage: A mirage of antiquity

In 149 BC Carthage suffer roman destruction but had a key role before and survives after. 
Original settlers were Berbers, semi-nomad libyans with a 8000 year lineage (some traditions of theirs in the making of food and basic living still survive in modern day Carthage). Around 700 BCE phoenicians from Lebanon take over, followed by Romans.

Not just the history but myth of Carthage are mixed with Rome’s: Phoenician Dido suicides over Aeneas, who goes on to found rome according to latter republican story.

Carthage reaches its zenith on the 6C. At this point the main deities are Baal- Hammon (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Terracotta_statue_of_Baal-Hammon_on_a_throne_AvL.JPG) and Tanit fertility goddess. Her symbol persists to this day (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Tophet_Carthage.2.jpg)

### Roman-Punic Wars 246 BC - 146 BC

Not to be confused with the greco-punic wars much earlier over sicily (600-250), the Roman punic wars feature hannibal crossing the alps, and the eventual destruction of carthage. 

The most representative piece of architecture of the time is not exactly in Carthage but nearby in the surviving Dougga Theater, the best preserved african roman theater of its time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga)

By the 7C Carthage is taken over by muslims.

## Civil Wars 1BCE

59 BCE Caesar Rises
44 Caesar dies, Marc Anthony and Cleopatra, Triumvirate 
31 Octavian rallies people against Marc Anthony and consolidates
27 Rise of Augustus as sole Emperor

Meanwhile in architecture first experimentation with concrete is taking place. Representative pieces are the Fortuna Primigenia sanctuary in Panestre (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestrina#/media/File:Santuario_emiciclo_colonne_4.JPG) 

Portraiture is veristic, as shown even by the first Julius Caesar coin. However, the greek influence is also very much present, as shown by the idolino de Pesaro,  an augustan time roman copy of a greek sculpture by Polykleitos.

# Early Empire: Augustus

Octavius beats Marc Anthony with the help of Agrippa, mainly in the famous naval battle of Actium. This consolidation starts the peaceful and productive period of the empire known as Pax Augusta or Pax Romana (27BC to 180)

The Roman statue of Augustus based on the Doryphoros of Polykleitos is by far the most recognizable of the time. The small figure at the feet of Augustus is not a homunculus as claimed by some occultists but Cupid, son of Venus, a nice allusion and connection to Caesar, the adoptive Father of Augustus who claimed to descend from the Goddess herself.

Augustus was the initiator/big force behind the notion of the Romans as Trojans. Aeneas comes back from Troy with his dad in his shoulder and his Son lulus.

## Interim: Historical Veracity of Troy

The story narrated in the Iliad was meant to take place around 1200 BC. The poem was written around 8C and was very popular in Augustus time. Agamemnon leads Achilles and other mycenaeans against the trojans. 

Although widely credited for the discovery of archeological troy in Turkey in 1868, Heinrich Schleiman was definitely NOT the first one to make the discovery but rather the person with enough money to claim it and publicize it. Calvert had made the discovery in Hissarlix years before.

## Augustan Rome

18 BCE Legistation fomenting family values is passed. Idea of a golden age permeates art.   Augustus complained of having two wayward daughters: Rome and Julia. Livia is indeed a key figure in the process of promoting the legislation and exiling Julia. 

Typical of these ideals, of the high values and quality of the time is The Ara Pacis, a temple to Pax built between 13 and 9 BC. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis#/media/File:Ara_Pacis_Rom.jpg

## Interim: Quick timeline of Imperial Rome

Augustus: 31BCE-14CE
Tiberius: -37 
Claudius: -54
Nero: -68

## Tiberius and Caligula: Mythological grandeur

Tiberius art in Capri and Sperlonga is highly theatrical and mythological including homer scenes, notably the surviving sculptures of odysseus ship attacked by Scylla: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperlonga_sculptures#/media/File:Gruppo_di_scilla,_sperlonga.jpg
 
Arrezo Red Pottery also popular around the time of Caligula, which in general was a continuation of the Tiberian style.

## Claudius : Rustication

As shown in the Porta Maggiore, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Porta_Maggiore_Roma.JPG, the style during Claudius goes a curious transformation into deliberately simpler more brute finishes called Rustication.

## Nero: Neronian Baroque

Although the two major sources, Tacitus and Suetonius, differ in their focus of the tragedy, one directly blaming Nero, the other concentrating mostly on the effects of the fire, what is certain is the burning of rome in 64 was true and the myth that Nero was playing the lyre and singing while it happened was given credence, if not factually, at least in spirit as he had displayed tremendously bad taste in his own “theater performances” where similar events happen.
### The Domus Aurea

After the fire of 64 the area on the palatine hill was taken by Nero and the Domus Aurea was constructed. The center of the Domus Aurea was adorned by a 30ft statue of Nero as Helios, known as the Colossus of Nero as it was modeled after the Rhodian sculpture.

The neronian baroque was full of complications and games of waterfalls and concrete.

It is also at this time that the fourth style of Pompeyan walls come into being, characterized by the baroque mixture of square tabulae with the trompe l’oeil.

Typical of the time is also the house of the dioscuri in Pompeii which shows murals of Achiles at Skyro (crossdressing Achiles enter courts of king and seduces daughter, a popular theme generating no less than 30 operas)

## Interim:  The Four styles of Pompeiian murals

First Style: 200-80 BC tablatures and blocks of color, flatness
Second style:  80-20  simulation of marble (marble veneering), Trompe l’oeil of still life
Third Style: 10-60 Emphasis on ornate architectural illusions
Fourth Style: 60-79 AD Combination of all predecessors

## The Flavians

After the suicide of Nero in 68, the period until July of 69 is known as the year of four emperors. In succession Galba, Vitellius, Otho, and finally Vespatian take the throne. Vespatian is the first of the Three Flavians. 

Vespatian: 69-79
Titus (son of Vespatian): 79-81
Domitian (also son of Vespatian): 81-96 

### Vespatian & Titus - The amphiteater, Colliseum 

Vespatian takes the huge lake of Domus Aurea and creates the Flavian Amphiteater. It is also during this time that the colosseum is built (finished actually under Titus). It was an arena but also could hold Naumachia (sea battle recreations).

### Domitian: Arch of Titus 

The most important architectural piece from the time was the Arch of titus raised by Domitian to commemorate his brother also celebrate domination of the jews.

The arch of titus include the very nice catenaries, rosting to very dramatic and scenes including the apotheosis of Titus.

Finally Domitian is assasinated.

# Rome at it's Zenith: "The five good emperors"

Marcus Cocceius Nerva has a short term from 96-98. Trajan (Marcus Ulpius Trajanus) a much larger one from 98-117.

## Trajan

Trajan was an effective administrator and a master of propaganda. He consolidated control of center europe and was succesful in the wars with Decebalus (101-102). This period which would be known as high empire is epitomized in architecture by the  Column of Trajan, an impressive monument of 625 reliefs. Also significant the trajan market and the apollodorus of damascus.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column#/media/File:Trajan_column_(Rome)_September_2015-1.jpg

## Hadrian

Hadrian ruled from 117-138.  Without a doubt the most memorable architecture of his reign is the Pantheon, temple to all gods, which uniquely combines classical front columns with a dome back.

An interesting aspect of the period is sculpture, which includes facial hair for hadrian and contrasts the unruly hair with polished face. A certain tendency towards dematerialization of features.

### Interim: Summary of the five good emperors

  - Nerva: 96-98, Mosaics
  - Trajan: 98-117, Column of Trajan
  - Hadrian: 117-138, Pantheon
  - Antonius Pius: 138-161,
  - Marcus Aurelius:  161-180, Column


## Antonius Pius

Characteristic of the Antonine period, and indeed of Antonius himself, a capable and non-flashy improver rather than radical innovator, is the Sarcophagus of Via Amendola, which is a proficient collage of previous style.

## Marcus Aurelius

Marcus has to contend with the plague in 161 and his reign is the last of the "good emperors." Rome never really recovers from the crisis that ensues. His column is perhaps the most mnemonic architecture feature of the time. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_of_Marcus_Aurelius#/media/File:Column.of.marcus.aurelius.complete.arp.jpg

# Severan Dinasty: Decline and Crisis

After Commodus (succesor of Marcus) dies the Praetorian guard puts the title of emperor literally on sale. Rapid succesion and chaos ensues. It is a period of unrest and the famous 193, year of five emperors (Pertinax,Didius,Julianus,Pescennius Niger, Clodus Albinus and Septimus Severus). Septimus Severus is the last man standing.

## Septimus Severus and Caracalla

Septimus reigns from 193-211, he was not a Roman but a Lybian, and interested in syrian mysticism.

Ruthless Caracalla brutally kills his brother Geta and erases his name from monuments (it is interesting to see caracalla's bust looks the part). Caracalla reigns from 211-217. The public baths on the south, an important social feature, bear his name.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla#/media/File:Rom_Caracalla-Thermen_von_S%C3%BCden.JPG
 
## 3C Crisis

After Caracalla emperors come and go in rapid succesion. Caracalla is killed and is succeeded by Macrinus. Macrinus in turn is victim of a plot by his aunt Julia which results in the ascencion of 14 year old Elagabulus.

Elagabulus instates a sol invictus cult (syrian divinity), replacing the head of jupiter for his liking and ends up assasinated in 222 and succeeded by the last of the Severans, Alexander Severus who rules from 222-235.

### Interim: Summary of Severans

 - Septimus Severus: 193-198
 - w/ Caracalla: 198-209
 - w/ Caracalla and Geta: 209-211
 - Caracalla and Geta: 211-211
 - Caracalla: 211-217
 - Macrinuss: 217-218
 - Elegabalus: 218-222
 - Alexander Severus: 222-235

What can be said about the architecture and art in this period is basically that it was a more crass, diluted version of their predecessors, the syrian influence also palpable.

3C Sculpture features a sort of Neo-verism as shown in the bust of caracalla. 

# End of Rapid Succesion and Diocletian Rule

With the ascencion of Diocletian (286-305), a period of relative peace and stability ensues. He attempts at setting the foundations of a stable line of succesion by the introduction of the tetrarchy, where two older emperors, two Augusti would train simultaneously their successors, two Caesari. Diocleatian prepares Galerius, Maximian prepares Constantus.

By the time of Maximinus and Constantine ultra realistic representation in sculpture breaks down into simplified form e.g. shadow of beard but crassly divided forehead. By 290 CE dematerialization takes a strong hold and concept triumphs over likeness.

Perhaps not surprisingly the scheme doesn't quite work. Galerius does relatively well but upon the retirement of Diocletian in 305 and the death of maximian, struggle ensues.

Maxentius, son of maximian declares himself emperor. Constantine, son of Constantus also declares himself emperor.

The matter is settled in the famous Milvian Bridge in 312, with the rise of the first Christian Emperor.

# Rise of Christianity

With the movement of the capital to Constantinople (modern day Istanbul, previous to Constantine Byzantium) in 330 the focus shifts and less development in Rome occurs. The most characteristic is perhaps the Arch of Constantine, situated between the colliseum and the palatine hill, build in 315 AD, which celebrates the victory of Maxentius.

After this Rome suffers greatly because of Malaria epidemics which decimate the population. By hte end of the 6C population would fall from 1M to about 100K people.

# Fall of Rome

The date of the fall of rome is officialy cited as 476 when Odoacer deposed the emperor Romulus. The last major addition to the architecture ofthe western empire was the monument of Phocas around 608.
